### Explanation of the video：
  - Illustration：The video demonstrates our proposed multimodal semantic communication system. During the transmission process, text is used instead of the original video for transmission. GPT is employed to disambiguate and correct the transmitted text. Finally, the video is reconstructed based on user identity and voice characteristics according to the transmitted text.
